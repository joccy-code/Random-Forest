# Random Forest — Lab

This repository contains a simple lab exploring Random Forest models using a Jupyter notebook.

## Project overview
The lab demonstrates how to:
- Load and explore a dataset
- Preprocess features
- Train and evaluate Random Forest models
- Inspect feature importance
- Tune basic hyperparameters and compare results

The primary artefact is:
- `Lab_06_Random_Forest_(1).ipynb` — an interactive Jupyter notebook with code, visualizations, and explanations.

## Repository structure
- Lab_06_Random_Forest_(1).ipynb — main notebook
## Requirements
Recommended Python version: 3.8+

Core Python packages used in the notebook:
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- jupyter (or jupyterlab)

You can install them with pip:
```
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```
Or create a `requirements.txt` with the packages above and run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to run
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/joccy-code/Random-Forest.git
cd Random-Forest
```
2. Install dependencies (see above).
3. Start Jupyter:
```
jupyter notebook
# or
jupyter lab
```
4. Open `Lab_06_Random_Forest_(1).ipynb` in your browser and run the cells.

Alternatively, open the notebook directly in Google Colab by using the repository URL (File → Open Notebook → GitHub) and pasting the notebook path.
